  - I found out that data fidelity term(|d-Fu0|^2) is not converging on the CG algorithm in the 'u0' minimization equation.
      I guess that is because |d-Fu0| is not a positive definite. (SENSE recon, |d-FS*x| is pos-def due to S'F'FS guarantee the pos-def)
        -> |u-Sx| term is converge. I think that means, the argmin minimisation tries to find the solution in |u-Sx| term 
        under the constraint which enforces closeness with |d-Fu0|.
         
  - After checking the reference code(Fessler groups's code, https://github.com/ismrmrd/ismrmrd-paper)
      -> They solve the inverse matrices of 2-norm by making an each(N,NL) size of a matrix using that the denoted matrices are sparse.
      -> I've tried to solve those equations using CG but I kept wondering the process what I've done.
      "If we convert one large scale problem into multiple small-scale yet using CG, which is also applied on a large-scale problem, 
      is it really effective way?". However, if we can convert the inverse matrix into just elemental-wise multiplication, 
      the problem is in a TOTALLY different approach and SUPER effective.

  - CODE CODE CODE!
  - wavelet function yield different result from mine. In this paper, they emphasize on 'time-invariant' orthogonal wavelet and
    their code returns wavelet pictures which have the same sizes in every wavelet level. I think they meant it.

  - GOAL : 
        1. manipulate the reference code into the most simple style, and try to establish a code step by step.
        2. After doing that, figure out what's the problems of my code.
        
  - raw data(k-data) =! FT(sosImg * sensitivity map)
    I think) In SENSE-based solution gives a more pretty solution with later data(FT(sosImg * smap)).
              | smap  <--LPF--- [DATA] ---FT--> coilIm --SOS--> Img  |
              |   S'           d = FSx+e                        (x') |
             
             As I mentioned, d =! FS'x'=d'
             In this code, they try to find d' by manipulating the d with S'
             Therefore, with RAW k-space data, the resulting quality is slightly degraded.

  - Things to be understood
      1. 'operatior notation' vs 'matrix notation'
          1.1 Background knowledge on dealing with inverse matrices in the Fourier domain
              (matrix multiplication(convolution I guess) <-> pixel-wise multiplication)
