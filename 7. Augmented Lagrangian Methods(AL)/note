  - I found out that data fidelity term(|d-Fu0|^2) is not converge with CG algorithm in the 'u0' minimization equation.
      I guess that is because |d-Fu0| is not a positive definite. (SENSE recon, |d-FS*x| is pos-def due to S'F'FS gurantee the pos-def)
        -> |u-Sx| term is converge. 
           I think that means, the argmin minimisation try to find the solution in |u-Sx| term but close with |d-Fu0|.
         
  - After checking the reference code(fessler groups's code, https://github.com/ismrmrd/ismrmrd-paper)
      -> They solve the inverse matrices of 2-norm by making a each(N,NL) size of matrix using that the denoted matrices are sparse.
      -> I've tried to solve those equations using CG but I kept wondering the process what I've done.
      "If we solve the one large scale problem with multiple small-scale using CG, which is also applied on large-scale problem, is it 
      really effective way?". However, if we can convert the inverse matrix into just elemental-wise multiplication, the problem is in
      a TOTALLY different approach and SUPER effective.

  - CODE CODE CODE!
  - wavelet function yield different result from mine. In this paper they emphasize on 'time-invariant' orthogonal wavelet and
    thier code returns wavelet pictures which have same sizes in every wavelet level. I think they meant it.

  - GOAL : 
        1. manipulate the reference code into most simple style, and try to establish a code step by step.
        2. After done that, figure our what's the problems of my code.
        
  - raw data(k-data) =! FT(sosImg * sensitivity map)
    I think) In SENSE-based solution gives more pretty solution with later data(FT(sosImg * smap)).
              | smap  <--LPF--- [DATA] ---FT--> coilIm --SOS--> Img  |
              |   S'           d = FSx+e                        (x') |
             
             As I mentioned, d =! FS'x'=d'
             In this code, they try to find d' by manipulating the d with S'
             Therefore, with Direct k-space data, the result quality is slightly degraded.
